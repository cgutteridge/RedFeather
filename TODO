[done] manage_resources page
	- needs to embody a fairly simple workflow. i dont think we are too far off. We should include some blurb about best practices

[done] resource page
	- duplicate the functionality in the big demo but lets have a slicker style sheet	

[done] style
	- it looks like poop, yo

[done] browse page
	- needs to list all the files we have metadata about in a clean way. Javascript search if its not too hard.

[done] RSS export
	- if we can demo this working with expert JISC will be pleased

[done] user sessions
	- sooner or later we need to sort out a basic authentication
	- just a password - there is no need for a user account system

RDF export
	- straight forward serialization, got to be a bit careful about our choice of URIs

JSON export
	- maybe just test to find out if we are on php5.1 and use theres

OAI endpoint
	- might be hard but we are gunna need one

[off scope for monday] make everthing as a plugin
	- this way we can test the plugin system to make sure it is adequate for our needs
	- prevents us from having to work on one huge file
	- we can determine what functionality should be in the core and create that file later

Update workflow 
	- each file being annotated should have an ID prefix instead of [] array syntax
	- this allows us to have multiple fields for a single item
	- example, a file may have multiple creators.

[off scope for monday] Bulk upload
	- gurn feature but you know we are gunna need it...
