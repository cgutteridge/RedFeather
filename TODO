RDF export
	- straight forward serialization, got to be a bit careful about our choice of URIs

JSON export
	- maybe just test to find out if we are on php5.1 and use theres

OAI endpoint
	- might be hard but we are gunna need one

[off scope for monday] make everthing as a plugin
	- this way we can test the plugin system to make sure it is adequate for our needs
	- prevents us from having to work on one huge file
	- we can determine what functionality should be in the core and create that file later

[first task done] Update workflow 
	- each file being annotated should have an ID prefix instead of [] array syntax
	- this allows us to have multiple fields for a single item
	- example, a file may have multiple creators.

[off scope for monday] Bulk upload
	- gurn feature but you know we are gunna need it...
	- I think this should be a plugin and not part of the standard suite (mrt)

[new potential feature] Download archive as ZIP
	- need to scope out what exactly will be downloaded in terms of metadata and files
	- also, whether or not to export as plain html (so you don't need the php)
